# Validation rubrics

## The validator's contract

A validator runs in a fresh context and receives exactly three things: the acceptance criteria, the artifact or diff under review, and the rubric for its phase.

It does not receive the author's reasoning, transcript, intermediate notes, or the author's own assessment. If a validator can see how the artifact was argued for, it reviews the argument instead of the artifact.

A validator has read and execute access. It has no write access to source files. It reports; it does not repair.

## Verdicts

| Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `PASS` | Every criterion is met. No blockers. Proceed. |
| `CONDITIONAL` | Criteria are met but named blockers must close first. Author closes them, appends a new numbered round. |
| `FAIL` | At least one criterion is unmet, or a blocker invalidates the approach. Return to the phase the defect belongs to. |

## Severities

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BLOCKER` | Violates a criterion, or is a correctness, security or data-loss defect. Must close before proceeding. |
| `IMPORTANT` | Will cause a real problem soon but violates no stated criterion. Close now or record as follow-up with an owner. |
| `NIT` | Style, naming, phrasing. Never blocks. Never a reason to open a round two. |
| `PRE_EXISTING` | The defect is real and predates this change. Record it; do not expand this work item to fix it. |

## Evidence rules

- Every finding names a file and a line. A finding without a location is not actionable and does not count.
- Every claim that a check passes or fails includes the command and its pasted output. "Tests pass" without output is not evidence.
- Every criterion in an implementation review gets an explicit per-criterion verdict. Silence on a criterion is a failure of the review, not a pass for the code.
- At least one negative test per criterion: a case that should fail and does. A suite that only exercises the happy path does not establish the criterion.

## Anti-rubber-stamp rules

A validator must run the verification command itself and paste the output. It may not rely on the author's statement that the command was run, and may not rely on the author's statement that a previous finding was fixed — re-run the check, not the claim.

## Anti-over-finding rules

A validator is never instructed to find a minimum number of problems. A reviewer told to find gaps will manufacture them, and manufactured findings train everyone to ignore reviews.

Flag as `BLOCKER` or `IMPORTANT` only what affects correctness or a stated criterion. Everything else is a `NIT`. A review of sound work correctly returns `PASS` with a short `NIT` list or nothing at all.

## Loop limits

- Three rounds maximum per phase. On the third `FAIL`, stop iterating and rewrite the plan from scratch.
- Findings accumulate. A round-two report appends to the record; it never replaces round one.
- Oscillation check: before opening a new round, compare the finding set to the previous round. If a finding is materially identical, the loop is not converging. Abort and escalate to a human.
- Route the loop-back by defect class. A plan defect goes to the plan phase. An implementation defect goes to the implement phase. Patching code to satisfy a plan-level finding buries the defect instead of fixing it.

## Reviewer strength

The reviewer is the ceiling on what review can catch. A weaker reviewer reviewing stronger output makes the result worse, not better. Reviewers get the strongest available model — see `model-routing.md`.

Self-review by the authoring agent is not validation. It measures close to zero. It may be used as a cheap pre-filter before the real review; it may never replace it.
